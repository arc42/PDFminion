### Explanation

The low test coverage stems from the fact that a lot of functionality can only be realistically tested by manually inspecting the generated PDF files.


## Features

When creating multiple PDF documents, you often need to add page numbers, headers, footers, or combine multiple PDF files into a single file.
PDFminion can do that for you - from a terminal and the command line, on macOS, Linux and Windows platforms.
