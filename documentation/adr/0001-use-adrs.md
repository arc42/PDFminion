# Architecture Decision Record: Using ADRs for Technical Documentation

## Status
Accepted

## Date: 2024-11-18

## Context
We need a sustainable way to document technical decisions that:
- Captures the context and reasoning at the time of decision
- Is easy to maintain alongside code
- Provides historical context for future maintainers
- Supports clear communication within the team

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as our primary means of documenting significant technical decisions.

## Format
Each ADR will be:
- Written in Markdown
- Stored in `/documentation/adr` directory
- Named using pattern: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
- Include sections: Status, Date, Context, Decision, Consequences

## Reasons

1. **Time-Stamped Context**
- Captures why decisions were made at a specific point in time
- Helps future maintainers understand historical choices

2. **Version Control Integration**
- ADRs live with the code
- Changes tracked in git


### Cons
1. **Maintenance Required**
- Must be kept up to date
- Requires discipline to create consistently


## Notes
- ADRs are immutable once accepted
- Superseded decisions should be marked as such
- Not every decision needs an ADR - focus on significant architectural choices
