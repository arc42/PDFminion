# Based upon OneFlow Jekyll Theme

This site is based upon the [OneFlow Jekyll Theme](), created by [Per Starke](https://perstarke-webdev/).


## Getting started & development 

### How to start a development docker container
To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.  
- Make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.  
- Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run ```docker compose up```.

Your site will then be visible at ```http://0.0.0.0:4000/``` in any browser.
